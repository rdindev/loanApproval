# Loan Approval Prediction
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction repository! This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess loan approval using Python and machine learning techniques. The project involves the following key steps:

* Data Loading: Importing and organizing the dataset.
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data distributions, patterns, and relationships.
* Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
* Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
* Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction.
* Model Training: Training the selected models on the training data.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics.
* This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources necessary to build and evaluate a robust loan approval prediction model.

### Project Overview

Loans play a crucial role in today's society, serving as a vital financial tool for individuals to meet various needs. However, the decision-making process for approving loans involves careful consideration of multiple factors. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant information such as gender, marital status, dependents, income, and more.
